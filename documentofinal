It is the smallest and most acute of the instruments of his family (who still owns the viola, the cello, corresponding to the Soprano of the human voice). The violin has four strings, with tuning from the sharpest to the most severe: Mi5, Lá4, Ré4 and Sol3. The tone of the violin is sharp, bright and strident, but depending on the string used and the way it is played, more velvety tones can be produced. Sound is usually produced by rubbing the bristles of a wooden bow over the strings. It can also be performed by pinching or strumming the ropes (pizzicato), by friction of the wood part of the bow (col legno), or even by percussion with the fingers or the back of the bow.
